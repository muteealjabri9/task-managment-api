**Simple Task Management API üìù**   
A straightforward and lightweight RESTful API for managing tasks, built with Java and Spring Boot. This project uses an in-memory List as a fake data source to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities.

__‚ú® Main Features__  
__Add New Tasks__: Create and add new tasks.

__Update Existing Tasks__: Modify the title and description of a task.

__Delete Tasks__: Remove a task from the list.

__Mark as Done__: Change the status of a task to complete.

__View Tasks__: Retrieve all tasks, or filter them by their completion status (done/undone).

__üì¶ Data Model__  
The Task object has the following structure:

JSON
```
{
  "id": "9f327068-3475-4d77-ae0e-9941311dc01b",
  "title": "Implement the API",
  "description": "Finish all the endpoints for the task management project.",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-16T07:20:30.123Z",
  "isDone": false
}
```
